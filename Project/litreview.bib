	abstract = {Phishing research presents conflicting findings regarding the psychological predictors of phishing susceptibility. The present work aimed to resolve these discrepancies by utilizing a diverse online sample and email set. Participants completed a survey that included an email classification task and measured several individual differences, including phishing awareness, age, impulsivity, curiosity, and personality (the Big-5). Phishing susceptibility was measured by participants' ability to distinguish between phishing and legitimate emails. Three regression analyses were performed to predict email discrimination ability; (1) an age model, (2) a deficient self-regulation model (i.e., impulsivity, response times, and curiosity), and (3) a personality (i.e., the Big-5) model. Overall, phishing susceptibility was predicted by younger age, higher levels of impulsivity and extraversion, lower levels of openness to experience and agreeableness, and quick responses. The present work identifies several populations that are particularly vulnerable to phishing attacks and may require targeted training interventions.},

	abstract = {Phishing attacks are a growing threat that has evolved along with technological advancements. Existing detection methods struggle with constantly evolving tactics and “zero-day” attacks that exploit unknown vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach for identifying phishing web pages built on phishing kits and, consequently, detecting such attack attempts. Our method, Phish Fighter, analyzes the {HTML} code structure, focusing on recurring blocks across different phishing pages derived from the same source. These features are then fed to clustering and classification components to detect common structural patterns without relying on textual or visual content. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing solutions, and is robust against attacks that target various brands. Furthermore, we implemented a dedicated module for continuous data updates for the Phish Fighter. This module effectively recognizes even “zero-day” phishing attempts by analyzing only three pages associated with a new phishing kit. In addition, we successfully identified the phishing pages created by cloning the original source code of legitimate entities without requiring prior knowledge to distinguish such clones. The results support the efficiency and accuracy of this approach: weighted precision, recall and F1 score are all greater than 90\%, and the respective micro-averaged metrics are above 95\%.},

Although this threat has been around for quite a long time, it is still very active and successful. In fact, the tactics used by attackers have been evolving continuously in the years to make the attacks more convincing and effective. In this context, phishing detection is of primary importance. The literature offers many diverse solutions that cope with this issue and in particular with the detection of phishing websites. This paper provides a broad and comprehensive review of the state of the art in this field by discussing the main challenges and findings. More specifically, the discussion is centered around three important categories of detection approaches, namely, list-based, similarity-based and machine learning-based. For each category we describe the detection methods proposed in the literature together with the datasets considered for their assessment and we discuss some research gaps that need to be filled.},

	abstract = {Phishing is one of the most prolific cybercriminal activities, with attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is, therefore, imperative to explore novel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human dimensions. Large Language Models ({LLMs}) offer significant promise for text processing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing attacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present {APOLLO}, a tool based on {OpenAI}’s {GPT}-4o to detect phishing emails and generate explanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus improving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance of {APOLLO} in classifying phishing emails; the results show that {GPT}-4o has exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97\% accuracy) and that this performance can be further improved by integrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect classification rate (99\% accuracy). To assess the perception of the explanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20 participants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing warnings. We compared the {LLM}-generated explanations to four baselines: a manually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The results show that not only the {LLM}-generated explanations were perceived as high quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and trustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using {LLMs} as a defense against phishing is a very promising approach, with {APOLLO} representing a proof of concept in this research direction.},

Which phish is captured in the net? Understanding phishing susceptibility and individual differences,"Sarno, D. M., Harris, M. S., & Black, D. G. (2023)",2023,,10.1002/acp.4075,"Phishing research presents conflicting findings regarding the psychological predictors of phishing susceptibility. The present work aimed to resolve these discrepancies by utilizing a diverse online sample and email set. Participants completed a survey that included an email classification task and measured several individual differences, including phishing awareness, age, impulsivity, curiosity, and personality (the Big‐5). Phishing susceptibility was measured by participants' ability to distinguish between phishing and legitimate emails. Three regression analyses were performed to predict email discrimination ability; (1) an age model, (2) a deficient self‐regulation model (i.e., impulsivity, response times, and curiosity), and (3) a personality (i.e., the Big‐5) model. Overall, phishing susceptibility was predicted by younger age, higher levels of impulsivity and extraversion, lower levels of openness to experience and agreeableness, and quick responses. The present work identifies several populations that are particularly vulnerable to phishing attacks and may require targeted training interventions.","The study explores phishing susceptibility through an online experiment where 150 participants classified 41 diverse emails (20 phishing from PhishTank, 21 legitimate) as safe or dangerous, rated confidence in decisions, and selected actions like follow request, investigate, flag, or ignore/delete. Participants completed questionnaires on phishing awareness, Big Five personality, impulsivity (BIS-11), and curiosity dimensions (deprivation sensitivity, stress tolerance, social curiosity). Using signal detection analysis, findings revealed that younger age, higher impulsivity, extraversion, and curiosity predicted poorer discrimination (lower d') and more liberal response bias (higher false alarms), while agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience were protective. Curiosity subscales linked to increased following of phishing requests. The research resolves prior inconsistencies by using a broad email set and highlights curiosity's role in driving risky behaviors, suggesting targeted interventions for vulnerable groups.","Examine how individual differences in experience, age, personality, impulsivity, and curiosity influence phishing susceptibility, confidence, and intended actions.",,,"Quantitative, experimental: Online classification task with psychometric surveys.",,,"Participants classified 41 emails sequentially, rated confidence (1-100), chose actions; completed PAQ, Big Five, BIS-11, curiosity scales; analyzed via signal detection (d', c), correlations, regressions.",,Phishing: PhishTank; legitimate: researchers' collections.,"150 participants; 41 emails (20 phishing, 21 legitimate).",,,,,"Younger, impulsive, extraverted, curious more susceptible; agreeable, conscientious, open less; curiosity increases request-following; experience unrelated to accuracy but boosts confidence.",,,,,Self-report biases; no spear-phishing; online sample limits generalizability; lacks cognitive decline groups; potential email irrelevance.,,,,,,,,Applies signal detection theory; novel curiosity focus clarifies risks; diverse emails reduce biases.,"N.

Security awareness of computer users: A phishing threat avoidance perspective,"Arachchilage, N. A. G., & Love, S. (2014)",2014,,10.1016/j.chb.2014.05.046,"Phishing is an online identity theft, which aims to steal conﬁdential information such as username, pass-
word and online banking details from its victims. To prevent this, anti-phishing education needs to be
considered. Therefore, the research reported in this paper examines whether conceptual knowledge or
procedural knowledge has a positive effect on computer users’ self-efﬁcacy to thwart phishing threats.
In order to accomplish this, a theoretical model based on Liang and Xue’s (2010) Technology Threat
Avoidance Theory (TTAT) has been proposed and evaluated. Data was collected from 161 regular com-
puter users to elicit their feedback through an online questionnaire. The study ﬁndings revealed that
the interaction effect of conceptual and procedural knowledge positively impacts on computer users’
self-efﬁcacy, which enhances their phishing threat avoidance behaviour. It can therefore be argued that
well-designed end-user security education contributes to thwart phishing threats.","This study investigates phishing susceptibility through a lens of user security awareness, proposing a model based on Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT) where phishing is the malicious IT threat and anti-phishing education is the safeguard. It posits that self-efficacy drives avoidance motivation and behavior, influenced by procedural (""know how"") and conceptual (""know why"") knowledge. A pilot survey refined a questionnaire measuring these constructs, followed by a main study with 161 undergraduates aged 18-25. Participants assessed phishing URLs for knowledge levels and rated self-efficacy, motivation, and behavior on Likert scales. Analysis via regression, correlation, and ANOVA revealed no individual effects of procedural or conceptual knowledge on self-efficacy, but their interaction significantly boosted it, explaining 15% variance in self-efficacy, 29% in motivation, and 33% in behavior—higher than prior TTAT applications. Findings underscore combined knowledge types in education to empower users against evolving phishing, though limited by sample demographics and focus.","Examine if conceptual or procedural knowledge positively affects users' self-efficacy to thwart phishing threats, using TTAT framework.",,,"Quantitative, survey-based with pilot and main questionnaire.",,,"Pilot (n=20) refined questionnaire; main (n=161) online survey assessing procedural/conceptual knowledge via URL identification, self-efficacy/motivation/behavior via Likert items; analyzed with Cronbach's alpha, regression, correlation, ANOVA.",,Survey data from Brunel/Bedfordshire universities; no external link.,161 participants (main); 20 (pilot).,,,,,"Interaction of conceptual/procedural knowledge boosts self-efficacy (Sig.=0.033), enhancing motivation (29% variance) and avoidance behavior (33% variance); no individual knowledge effects.",,,,,Young sample (18-25); no URL redirection; needs larger/diverse samples; emotion-focused coping unexplored.,,,,,,,,TTAT adaptation highlights education's role; interaction effect key for practical anti-phishing training.,"H.

The ability of Machine learning and ensemble learning models to process large datasets and complex relationships, and to learn from data have made it easier to detect phishing websites, which have become one of the major problems in modern-day security findings. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of various ensemble techniques is carried out, particularly focusing on algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost, in addition to traditional classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these machine learning and ensemble models, the benchmarks dataset having phishing and normal site samples, the study assesses the performance of the mentioned models using distinct evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The study focuses its attention on the performance of the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ensemble models compared to their single classifier counterparts. The findings revealed that ensemble techniques have a better performance in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate, and overall performance. Consequently, the research reinforces that these ensemble learning methods possess the capability of providing strength, flexibility, and efficiency under practical conditions of application. However, there are still some areas for improvement in developing and applying more advanced algorithms.","This study dissects phishing into three steps—opening the email (involved users), clicking the link (risky users), and submitting data (high-risk users)—to pinpoint behavioral and demographic influences on susceptibility. Using psychometric tools like Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) for general risk-taking, Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) for domain risks, and General Decision-Making Style (GDMS) for styles, alongside a simulated phishing email offering a reward, researchers tested 135 Iranian participants (mostly young females, students). Exact logistic regressions revealed general risk-taking significantly predicts link clicking (Step 2), with women more prone; no effects in Steps 1 or 3. Avoidant decision-making weakly linked to clicking, but domain risks and other styles showed no impact. Demographics like age and education were insignificant, highlighting Step 2 as key vulnerability point for targeted interventions, though cultural and sample biases limit generalizability.","Investigate effects of risk-taking behavior, decision-making styles, and demographics (age, gender, education) on user responses in each step of a phishing process (opening email, clicking link, submitting data).",,,"Quantitative, experimental: Psychometric surveys and simulated phishing attack.",,,"Online: BART (balloon pumping for risk-taking), DOSPERT (30 items on social/recreational/financial risks), GDMS (25 items on styles); phishing email simulation tracking open/click/submit; exact logistic regressions on 135 responses.",,Iranian students/graduates; no link.,135 valid participants (from 148).,,,,,General risk-taking and female gender predict link clicking; avoidant style weakly associated; no effects on email opening or data submission; domain risks/age/education insignificant.,,,,,"Iranian sample (young, educated females); cultural biases; no spear-phishing; small high-risk group; self-selection; online vs. lab realism",,,,,40,,,Step-wise analysis enables precise mitigations; gender effect suggests tailored awareness for women.,"A.

Existing detection methods struggle with constantly evolving tactics and ‘‘zero-day’’ attacks that exploit unknown vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach for identifying phishing web pages built on phishing kits and, consequently, detecting such attack attempts. Our method, Phish Fighter, analyzes the HTML code structure, focusing on recurring blocks across different phishing pages derived from the same source. These features are then fed to clustering and classification components to detect common structural patterns without relying on textual or visual content. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing solutions, and is robust against attacks that target various brands. Furthermore, we implemented a dedicated module for continuous data updates for the Phish Fighter. This module effectively recognizes even ‘‘zero-day’’ phishing attempts by analyzing only three pages associated with a new phishing kit. In addition, we successfully identified the phishing pages created by cloning the original source code of legitimate entities without requiring prior knowledge to distinguish such clones. The results support the efficiency and accuracy of this approach: weighted precision, recall and F1 score are all greater than 90%, and the respective micro-averaged metrics are above 95%.","The paper presents Phish Fighter, an innovative self-updating machine learning framework for defending against phishing kits through detailed HTML code analysis.

These sequences serve as features for clustering similar phishing templates using a customized DBSCAN algorithm with a weighted Levenshtein distance metric, allowing dynamic group formation without predefined cluster counts. Labeled clusters train a classifier to categorize new pages as belonging to known kits or uncertain. For uncertain instances, the system triggers re-clustering to incorporate emerging zero-day kits, ensuring adaptive detection.

Applicability of ML in spam and phishing email filtering: review and approaches,"Gangavarapu, Jaidhar & Chanduka",2020,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-020-09814-9,"With the influx of technological advancements and the increased simplicity in communication, especially through emails, the upsurge in the volume of unsolicited bulk emails (UBEs) has become a severe threat to global security and economy. Spam emails not only waste users’ time, but also consume a lot of network bandwidth, and may also include malware as executable files. Alternatively, phishing emails falsely claim users’ personal information to facilitate identity theft and are comparatively more dangerous. Thus, there is an intrinsic need for the development of more robust and dependable UBE filters that facilitate automatic detection of such emails. There are several countermeasures to spam and phishing, including blacklisting and content-based filtering. However, in addition to content-based features, behavior-based features are well-suited in the detection of UBEs. Machine learning models are being extensively used by leading internet service providers like Yahoo, Gmail, and Outlook, to filter and classify UBEs successfully. There are far too many options to consider, owing to the need to facilitate UBE detection and the recent advances in this domain. In this paper, we aim at elucidating on the way of extracting email content and behavior-based features, what features are appropriate in the detection of UBEs, and the selection of the most discriminating feature set. Furthermore, to accurately handle the menace of UBEs, we facilitate an exhaustive comparative study using several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

Improving phishing email detection through deep learning with adaptive optimization,Hosseinzadeh et al.,2025,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-20668-5,"Phishing email attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, placing a heavy burden on cybersecurity, which requires more advanced detection techniques. Attackers often craft emails that closely resemble those from trusted sources, making it difficult for users and traditional filters to distinguish between legitimate and malicious messages. This paper introduces a new hybrid deep learning and optimizer architecture for detecting phishing emails based on the Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO). A hybrid architecture is proposed, comprising contextual embedding using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), feature extraction with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) temporal dependencies, and multi-head attention for refining the key feature focus in email text. The dataset used in this paper for phishing detection is obtained from the Kaggle website, which includes phishing and legitimate emails. Hyperparameter optimization with the MGO results in a robust model with good classification accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 96.8%, 97.2%, 95.4%, and 96.3%, respectively, for enhanced phishing email detection compared to baseline models. Also, the model reduces false positives by 2.5% compared to state-of-the-art conventional methods.

In the second level, we combine a set of manually-specified and automatically-extracted semantic features for spam detection in each domain. These features are meant to summarize the email content into compact topics discriminating spam from non-spam emails in an efficient way.

Overconfidence in Phishing Email Detection,"J Wang, Y Li, HR Rao",2016,JAIS,10.17705/1jais.00442,"This study examines overconfidence in phishing email detection. Researchers believe that overconfidence (i.e., where one’s judgmental confidence exceeds one’s actual performance in decision making) can lead to one’s adopting risky behavior in uncertain situations. This study focuses on what leads to overconfidence in phishing detection. We performed a survey experiment with 600 subjects to collect empirical data for the study. In the experiment, each subject judged a set of randomly selected phishing emails and authentic business emails. Specifically, we examined two metrics of overconfidence (i.e., overprecision and overestimation). Results show that cognitive effort decreased overconfidence, while variability in attention allocation, dispositional optimism, and familiarity with the business entities in the emails all increased overconfidence in phishing email detection. The effect of perceived self-efficacy of detecting phishing emails on overconfidence was marginal. In addition, all confidence beliefs poorly predicted detection accuracy and poorly explained its variance, which highlights the issue of relying on them to guide one’s behavior in detecting phishing. We discuss mechanisms to reduce overconfidence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,185,,,,,Smith
An Effective Cybersecurity Awareness Training Model: First Defense of an Organizational Security Strategy,"B Dash, MF Ansari",2022,,,"Security Education Training and Awareness plays a dynamic role for organizations in endorsing resources' thoughtfulness and accessibility. This paper determines the importance of security awareness training in dealing with cyber threats. This research uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), indicating that at-risk employees' behavior and information security awareness training execution are successful interventions. Yet, those investigations did not examine Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled training, so this study fills that literature gap. This analysis used a qualitative research design. The article examines employees' behavior and the effectiveness of AI-based security awareness training programs. The study here helps analyze information security awareness training in the workplace, encouraging behavioral transformations that would restrain data breaches by incorporating the users' exposure and the stringency of coercion and the retort to peril in prophesying behavior discretions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,141,,,,,Smith
Detecting Phishing SMS Based on Multiple Correlation Algorithms,G Sonowal,2020,,,"The SMS phishing is another method where the phisher operates the SMS as a medium to communicate with the victims and this method is identified as smishing (SMS + phishing). Researchers promoted several anti-phishing methods where the correlation algorithm is applied to explore the relevancy of the features since there are numerous features in the features corpus. The correlation algorithm assesses the rank of the features that is the highest rank leads to the more relevant to the appropriate assignment. Therefore, this paper analyses four rank correlation algorithms particularly Pearson rank correlation, Spearman’s rank correlation, Kendall rank correlation, and Point biserial rank correlation with a machine-learning algorithm to determine the best features set for detecting Smishing messages. The result of the investigation reveals that the AdaBoost classifier offered better accuracy. Further analysis shows that the classifier with the ranking algorithm that is Kendall rank correlation appeared superior accuracy than the other correlation algorithms. The inferred of this experiment confirms that the ranking algorithm was able to reduce the dimension of features with 61.53% and presented an accuracy of 98.40%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47,,,,,Smith
Phishnet: predictive blacklisting to detect phishing attacks,"P Prakash, M Kumar, RR Kompella, M Gupta",2010,,,"Phishing has been easy and effective way for trickery and deception on the Internet. While solutions such as URL blacklisting have been effective to some degree, their reliance on exact match with the blacklisted entries makes it easy for attackers to evade. We start with the observation that attackers often employ simple modifications (e.g., changing top level domain) to URLs. Our system, PhishNet, exploits this observation using two components. In the first component, we propose five heuristics to enumerate simple combinations of known phishing sites to discover new phishing URLs. The second component consists of an approximate matching algorithm that dissects a URL into multiple components that are matched individually against entries in the blacklist. In our evaluation with real-time blacklist feeds, we discovered around 18,000 new phishing URLs from a set of 6,000 new blacklist entries. We also show that our approximate matching algorithm leads to very few false positives (3%) and negatives (5%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,604,,,,,Smith
You've been warned: an empirical study of the effectiveness of web browser phishing warnings,"S Egelman, LF Cranor, J Hong",2008,,,"Many popular web browsers are now including active phishing warnings after previous research has shown that passive warnings are often ignored. In this laboratory study we examine the effectiveness of these warnings and examine if, how, and why they fail users. We simulated a spear phishing attack to expose users to browser warnings. We found that 97% of our sixty participants fell for at least one of the phishing messages that we sent them. However, we also found that when presented with the active warnings, 79% of participants heeded them, which was not the case for the passive warning that we tested---where only one participant heeded the warnings. Using a model from the warning sciences we analyzed how users perceive warning messages and offer suggestions for creating more effective warning messages within the phishing context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,951,,,,,Smith
APOLLO: A GPT-based tool to detect phishing emails and generate explanations that warn users,"Desolda, G., Greco, F., & Viganò, L.",2025,,,"Phishing is one of the most prolific cybercriminal activities, with attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is, therefore, imperative to explore novel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human dimensions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for text processing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing attacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present APOLLO, a tool based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o to detect phishing emails and generate explanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus improving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance of APOLLO in classifying phishing emails; the results show that GPT-4o has exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97% accuracy) and that this performance can be further improved by integrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect classification rate (99% accuracy). To assess the perception of the explanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20 participants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing warnings. We compared the LLM-generated explanations to four baselines: a manually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The results show that not only the LLM-generated explanations were perceived as high quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and trustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using LLMs as a defense against phishing is a very promising approach, with APOLLO representing a proof of concept in this research direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3733049,Recasens

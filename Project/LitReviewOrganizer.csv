A semantic-based classification approach for an enhanced spam detection,"N Saidani, K Adi, MS Allili (2020)",2020,,,"In this paper, we explore the use of a text semantic analysis to improve the accuracy of spam detection. We propose a method based on two semantic level analysis. In the first level, we categorize emails by specific domains (e.g., Health, Education, Finance, etc.) to enable a separate conceptual view for spams in each domain. In the second level, we combine a set of manually-specified and automatically-extracted semantic features for spam detection in each domain. These features are meant to summarize the email content into compact topics discriminating spam from non-spam emails in an efficient way. We show that the proposed method enables a better spam detection compared to existing methods based on bag-of-words (BoW) and semantic content, and leads to more interpretable results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,106,,,,,Smith
A comparative exploration of reputation systems for determining valid Indicators of Compromise,K Dirksen,2023,,,"In this thesis we present a first exploratory investigation into using reputation systems for threat exchanges. When using a reputation system, the data of a threat exchange cannot be directly used and instead a model of the underlying data is required as input for a threat exchange. We present such a model for a threat exchange. In this model, interactions between users are modelled based on the number of published IoCs that they have in common. This model is used on real world threat exchange data. As a sanity check on our data model, the resulting graph is explored to show that the model can be interpreted such that useful information can be obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,"Thesis paper, but provides many useful citations to other sources that could be handy",,Smith
iMCircle: Automatic Mining of Indicators of Compromise from the Web,"P Zhang, J Ya, T Liu, Q Li, J Shi, Z Gu",2019,,,"With the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are aggressively exchanged as forensic artifacts to help security professionals quickly identify and response cyber threats. Previous related studies mostly focus on extracting and generating IOCs from some fixed-point monitoring data sources, which are passive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present iMCircle, an innovation system that automatically mines IOCs from the Web by checking suspicious indicators with the help of open-source threat information. Based on the initial input of several suspicious indicators, iMCircle first collects their relevant public threat information from the Web and generates IOCs by checking whether those indicators are threat indicators in the target threat field. Second, it actively extracts new indicators from the search results as new inputs and checks them as described above. In that way, the system works in a circle and generates IOCs continuously. Running this system for almost two months in the real world, it has the appreciable performances on the active checking of suspicious indicators and the automatic generation of IOCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,Smith
Overconfidence in Phishing Email Detection,"J Wang, Y Li, HR Rao",2016,JAIS,,"This study examines overconfidence in phishing email detection. Researchers believe that overconfidence (i.e., where one’s judgmental confidence exceeds one’s actual performance in decision making) can lead to one’s adopting risky behavior in uncertain situations. This study focuses on what leads to overconfidence in phishing detection. We performed a survey experiment with 600 subjects to collect empirical data for the study. In the experiment, each subject judged a set of randomly selected phishing emails and authentic business emails. Specifically, we examined two metrics of overconfidence (i.e., overprecision and overestimation). Results show that cognitive effort decreased overconfidence, while variability in attention allocation, dispositional optimism, and familiarity with the business entities in the emails all increased overconfidence in phishing email detection. The effect of perceived self-efficacy of detecting phishing emails on overconfidence was marginal. In addition, all confidence beliefs poorly predicted detection accuracy and poorly explained its variance, which highlights the issue of relying on them to guide one’s behavior in detecting phishing. We discuss mechanisms to reduce overconfidence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,185,,,,,Smith
An Effective Cybersecurity Awareness Training Model: First Defense of an Organizational Security Strategy,"B Dash, MF Ansari",2022,,,"Security Education Training and Awareness plays a dynamic role for organizations in endorsing resources' thoughtfulness and accessibility. This paper determines the importance of security awareness training in dealing with cyber threats. This research uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), indicating that at-risk employees' behavior and information security awareness training execution are successful interventions. Yet, those investigations did not examine Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled training, so this study fills that literature gap. This analysis used a qualitative research design. The article examines employees' behavior and the effectiveness of AI-based security awareness training programs. The study here helps analyze information security awareness training in the workplace, encouraging behavioral transformations that would restrain data breaches by incorporating the users' exposure and the stringency of coercion and the retort to peril in prophesying behavior discretions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,141,,,,,Smith
Detecting Phishing SMS Based on Multiple Correlation Algorithms,G Sonowal,2020,,,"The SMS phishing is another method where the phisher operates the SMS as a medium to communicate with the victims and this method is identified as smishing (SMS + phishing). Researchers promoted several anti-phishing methods where the correlation algorithm is applied to explore the relevancy of the features since there are numerous features in the features corpus. The correlation algorithm assesses the rank of the features that is the highest rank leads to the more relevant to the appropriate assignment. Therefore, this paper analyses four rank correlation algorithms particularly Pearson rank correlation, Spearman’s rank correlation, Kendall rank correlation, and Point biserial rank correlation with a machine-learning algorithm to determine the best features set for detecting Smishing messages. The result of the investigation reveals that the AdaBoost classifier offered better accuracy. Further analysis shows that the classifier with the ranking algorithm that is Kendall rank correlation appeared superior accuracy than the other correlation algorithms. The inferred of this experiment confirms that the ranking algorithm was able to reduce the dimension of features with 61.53% and presented an accuracy of 98.40%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,47,,,,,Smith
Phishnet: predictive blacklisting to detect phishing attacks,"P Prakash, M Kumar, RR Kompella, M Gupta",2010,,,"Phishing has been easy and effective way for trickery and deception on the Internet. While solutions such as URL blacklisting have been effective to some degree, their reliance on exact match with the blacklisted entries makes it easy for attackers to evade. We start with the observation that attackers often employ simple modifications (e.g., changing top level domain) to URLs. Our system, PhishNet, exploits this observation using two components. In the first component, we propose five heuristics to enumerate simple combinations of known phishing sites to discover new phishing URLs. The second component consists of an approximate matching algorithm that dissects a URL into multiple components that are matched individually against entries in the blacklist. In our evaluation with real-time blacklist feeds, we discovered around 18,000 new phishing URLs from a set of 6,000 new blacklist entries. We also show that our approximate matching algorithm leads to very few false positives (3%) and negatives (5%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,604,,,,,Smith
You've been warned: an empirical study of the effectiveness of web browser phishing warnings,"S Egelman, LF Cranor, J Hong",2008,,,"Many popular web browsers are now including active phishing warnings after previous research has shown that passive warnings are often ignored. In this laboratory study we examine the effectiveness of these warnings and examine if, how, and why they fail users. We simulated a spear phishing attack to expose users to browser warnings. We found that 97% of our sixty participants fell for at least one of the phishing messages that we sent them. However, we also found that when presented with the active warnings, 79% of participants heeded them, which was not the case for the passive warning that we tested---where only one participant heeded the warnings. Using a model from the warning sciences we analyzed how users perceive warning messages and offer suggestions for creating more effective warning messages within the phishing context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,951,,,,,Smith

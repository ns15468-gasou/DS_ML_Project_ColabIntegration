% TODO @j-recasens Do you have any issues with making the sections non-numbered?
% I prefer that for readability, but am not married to it.
\section*{Introduction}
Introduce the project topic, its importance, and the scope of the review.

\section*{Methodology}
Explain the process of selecting articles, detailing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keywords used
    \item Databases accessed
    \item Inclusion and exclusion criteria
\end{itemize}

\section*{Literature Review}
Summarize and critically analyze each article, focusing on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The problem addressed
    \item Methods or approaches used
    \item Key findings and contributions
    \item Limitations or gaps
\end{itemize}

\section*{Synthesis and Conclusion}
Highlight overall trends and research gaps, and describe how your project addresses these gaps.

% @j-recasens As an FYI, I've learned that even if a source is in 
% litreview.bib, it won't show up in the compiled code without being \cite'd first.

%%%% Help Messages from IEEE:

%% \subsection{Identify the Headings}

% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.
